## Data analysis assignment 0

This assignment is intended to familiarize oneself with biological data and (eventually) refresh basic skills such as informative plotting and infer information from data. 
After loading data1.mat, data2.mat and data3.mat [function load()], you are required to plot them with appropriate labels on the axis and try to guess which type of data you are plotting (EEG, EMG or motion data) and estimate roughly what is the frequency content of the signal (tip: plotting data in time points instead of sample would help)
Once you are done, you should submit a single folder with the last and first names of all the group members. The folder must contain:

1.	MATLAB code (that is a running code to load the data and plot them, and having your considerations commented on the code)
2.	Figure with the plots

Additional information: 
Data1 sampling frequency: 2000 Hz
Data2 sampling frequency: 166Hz
Data3 sampling frequency: 250 Hz
